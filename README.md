## Introduction

If you're not familiar with the popular Dino Chrome game which surprisingly eases tension during a marathon coding session, you might be living under a rock. However, I'd like to introduce you to Dino-Terminal. Don't worry too much, you guessed right: It's the same Dino game (with more features) but in the terminal. 

Dino-Terminal is a simple dino game that is built on your terminal.
Here's what we don't want: The common dino longing for an affection outside Chrome.
